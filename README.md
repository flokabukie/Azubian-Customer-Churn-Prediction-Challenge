Customer Churn Prediction for an African Telecommunications Company that offers airtime and mobile data bundles. The company wants to develop a machine learning model that can accurately predict the likelihood of each customer "churning" â€“ becoming inactive and not making any transactions for 90 days.

The data was dowloaded from Zindi as a challenge.

To understand the data, we went through the variable definitions of the given columns which contains information related to telecommunications customers, including their region, tenure, recharge amount, frequency of recharge, revenue, data usage, and other variables.


### Evaluation 
The evaluation metric for this challenge is [Area Under the Curve (AUC)](https://zindi.africa/learn/zindi-error-metric-series-how-to-use-area-under-curve-auc-as-an-evaluation-metric-for-machine-learning/).

The values representing Churn are 0 and 1. Where 1 indicates the customer churned and 0 indicates the customer stayed with the telecom company.
